@article{Woodall,
abstract = {Statistical process control (SPC) charts are increasingly being used in healthcare to aid in process understanding, assess process stability, and identify changes that indicate either improvement or deterioration in quality. This chapter provides an overview of common uses of SPC in healthcare, and some guidance on the choice of appropriate charts for various applications. It also talks about implementation issues and more advanced SPC and related methods. The choice of an appropriate control chart depends on the type of data to be plotted. All data can be classified as either continuous (variable) or discrete (attribute). The chapter focuses on Shewhart-type control charts, after Walter Shewhart, the inventor of the control chart. Training in the use of control charting methods is best accomplished within an overall process improvement context, such as Six Sigma, Lean, or Lean Six Sigma.},
