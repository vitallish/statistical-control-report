abstract = {This article discusses the use of quality control techniques in the improvement of the trading, finance, banking, and service industries. One such technique being used to assess performance of trading machines is statistical process control (SPC). In addition, quality management initiatives are being implemented in Hong Kong banks to improve their competitive position. Finally, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and Total Quality Management (TQM) techniques are improving the competitiveness of banking and service industries in the U.S. Finally, some exploration into the improvement of government services using LSS and TQM practices is attempted.},

@article{lunderberg2007,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature regarding how statistical process control---with control charts as a core tool---has been applied to healthcare quality improvement, and to examine the benefits, limitations, barriers and facilitating factors related to such application. DATA SOURCES: Original articles found in relevant databases, including Web of Science and Medline, covering the period 1966 to June 2004. STUDY SELECTION: From 311 articles, 57 empirical studies, published between 1990 and 2004, met the inclusion criteria. METHODS: A standardised data abstraction form was used for extracting data relevant to the review questions, and the data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Statistical process control was applied in a wide range of settings and specialties, at diverse levels of organisation and directly by patients, using 97 different variables. The review revealed 12 categories of benefits, 6 categories of limitations, 10 categories of barriers, and 23 factors that facilitate its application and all are fully referenced in this report. Statistical process control helped different actors manage change and improve healthcare processes. It also enabled patients with, for example asthma or diabetes mellitus, to manage their own health, and thus has therapeutic qualities. Its power hinges on correct and smart application, which is not necessarily a trivial task. This review catalogues 11 approaches to such smart application, including risk adjustment and data stratification. CONCLUSION: Statistical process control is a versatile tool which can help diverse stakeholders to manage change in healthcare and improve patients' health.},

	@article{Raczynski,
abstract = {Statistical Process Control (SPC) has been an integral component of the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI's) maturity models for about nineteen years. This article describes an intellectual journey in which the primacy of SPC applied to software development processes is challenged. A main concept is that, for any measurable process characteristic, the notion that causes of variation can be separated into two distinct classes: 1) Normal (sometimes also referred to as common or chance) causes of variation and 2) assignable (sometimes also referred to as special) causes of variation. The idea is that most processes have many causes of variation, most of them are minor, can be ignored, and if we can only identify the few dominate causes, then we can focus our resources on those. SPC allows us to detect when the few dominant causes of variation are present. If the dominant (assignable) causes of variation can be detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. Once removed, the process is said to be stable, which means that its resulting variation can be expected to stay within a known set of limits, at least until another assignable cause of variation is introduced.},
